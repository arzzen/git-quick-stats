        display this help text in the terminal

ADDITIONAL USAGE
    You can set _GIT_SINCE and _GIT_UNTIL to limit the git time log
        ex: export _GIT_SINCE=\"2017-01-20\"
    You can set _GIT_LIMIT for limited output log
        ex: export _GIT_LIMIT=20
    You can set _GIT_LOG_OPTIONS for git log options
        ex: export _GIT_LOG_OPTIONS=\"--ignore-all-space --ignore-blank-lines\"
    You can exclude directories or files from the stats by using pathspec
        ex: export _GIT_PATHSPEC=':!pattern'
    You can set _GIT_MERGE_VIEW to view merge commits with normal commits
        ex: export _GIT_MERGE_VIEW=enable
    You can also set _GIT_MERGE_VIEW to only show merge commits
        ex: export _GIT_MERGE_VIEW=exclusive
    You can set _MENU_THEME to display the legacy color scheme
        ex: export _MENU_THEME=legacy
    You can set _GIT_BRANCH to set the branch of the stats
        ex: export _GIT_BRANCH=master"
